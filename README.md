### Patricia Campbell
Faculty at [Dawson College](https://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/) in MontrÃ©al

I have a long background in writing code (many languages & platforms including Linux & Android), and in writing socket libraries plus working with, designing and configuring network infrastructure.

My repos are either "research" engineering logs ex [working with docker & cloud](https://github.com/campbe13/docker-ecq2020) or for student consumption ex [code and lab samples](https://github.com/campbe13/JS320-2021) or
code I am playing with ex [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/campbe13/FizzBuzz)

More can be found on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/campbe13) __Note  for teachers__ gitlab is a better platform for students as private
repos are possible without teacher intervention & registration proccess   With github I have to review every year-ish 
in order to maintaine an educational account which gives me private repos.
